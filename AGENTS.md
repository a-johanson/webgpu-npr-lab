## General guardrails and style

* Organize the application logic in TypeScript in `src/`.
* Use modern ECMAScript patterns and TypeScript-specific type utilities (target ES2024 with ESNext module structure, avoid legacy TS).
* Prefer object-oriented design whenever it makes sense to combine data and logic into classes.
* Always generate TSDoc comments in accordance with the Google TypeScript Style Guide.
* Use American English spelling.
* After you apply edits, run `npm run check` to check for type errors and to apply linting & formatting.

## Collaboration and design workflow

* Before implementing substantial or potentially architectural changes, provide a short design note and wait for user approval.
* Treat a change as substantial when it introduces new abstractions, changes responsibilities, or has meaningful design uncertainty (not merely because multiple files are touched).
* Keep design notes concise and include:
	* problem framing and constraints,
	* plausible approaches (when applicable),
	* recommended approach with tradeoffs,
	* proposed responsibilities and data flow.

## Architecture guardrails

* Favor high cohesion and low coupling.
* Prefer composition and clear interfaces over large, multi-purpose classes.
* Keep orchestration thin and place core logic in focused components.
* Use established design patterns when they provide clear value; avoid pattern-driven overengineering.

## Pre-implementation check

Before coding, explicitly confirm to yourself:
* boundaries and dependencies are clear,
* interfaces are minimal and testable,
* the chosen design is the simplest approach that satisfies the requirements,
* you do not introduce redundant logic and types but re-use existing logic and types where appropriate.
